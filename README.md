# MINIMINE
A hobby project of mine to create a game in C for my TI-84 Plus CE.
My implementation of Minesweeper allows for the following:
- Flagging cells
- Opening 3x3's when flags permit
- Scrolling for large (16x30) games that go off screen (NOTE: A red line is used to denote the border)
- A pause screen to show remaining mines
- A time counter (in the pause screen)
- A menu to choose between the original three difficulties

# Building
Uses the [CE toolchain](https://github.com/CE-programming/toolchain/).
If you are compiling yourself, make sure to have the binaries on your PATH.
Having the correct clibs on your calculator is important as well.
